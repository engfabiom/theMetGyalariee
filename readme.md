# 🎨 The Met Gyalariee - Portfolio Art Exhibition

Welcome to **theMetGyalariee**, a React-based project designed to serve as both a study exercise and portfolio showcase. This digital gallery highlights the potential of modern web development technologies while offering an engaging platform to display artistic content.

## 🌟 Project Overview

TheMetGyalariee is a learning-oriented project, aiming to:

- Demonstrate skills in front-end web development using React and Redux.
- Showcase the ability to create dynamic, visually appealing web applications.
- Provide a practical example of state management and responsive design implementation.

This project is a fork of [Gyalariee](https://github.com/sandesnp/gyalariee.git), which originated with the same members, including Sandesh Shrestha. The initial project hosted by Sandesh was suspended due to personal priorities. To ensure its conclusion, the project was forked and continued under this repository.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Gallery Layout**: Navigate through an art collection in a seamless and intuitive design.
- **Detailed Artwork View**: Select an item to view detailed information, including the title, description, and historical context.
- **Search and Filter**: Quickly find artworks using filters by category, title, or keyword.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility across platforms.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML** - Markup for structuring the gallery and content.
- **CSS** - Styled components for an engaging user interface.
- **React** - Component-based library for building the front-end.
- **Redux** - State management for handling gallery data efficiently.
- **Axios** - HTTP client for fetching data locally or externally if required.
- **Anime.js** - Library for creating smooth animations and transitions.

## 📚 How It Works

- **Component-Based Architecture**: The application is built using reusable React components, making it scalable and maintainable.
- **State Management**: Redux is used to handle the gallery data, ensuring a predictable and efficient flow of information.
- **Responsive Design**: The gallery is styled with CSS to provide an optimal viewing experience on any device.
- **Smooth Animations**: Anime.js enhances the visual appeal by adding smooth transitions and animations.
